#### Credits:
- Grid Texture/s from [KenneyNL](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/prototype-textures)
- To create this project I watched [Jeremy Bullock's Godot First Person Controller Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Etpq-d5af6M&list=PLTZoMpB5Z4aD-rCpluXsQjkGYgUGUZNIV) and [Godot's FPS tutorial Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/tutorials/3d/fps_tutorial/) to understand how it works. There is some code from both tutorials with tweaks, that fix bugs.
